The Smart Vehicle Expert System is an intelligent web-based application designed to automate vehicle identification and assist users in making informed vehicle selection decisions. The system allows users to upload an image of any vehicle, which is then analyzed using computer vision and machine learning techniques (or a realistic simulated model) to identify key vehicle attributes such as vehicle type, company, model, body type, color, fuel type, and approximate price range.

To enhance user experience, the system provides an interactive digital showroom interface where users can view vehicle images with smooth animations such as rotation or card-flip effects, allowing exploration of alternate vehicle views. In addition to identification, the system features an expert recommendation module that collects user preferences including budget, fuel type, seating or load capacity, environmental suitability, and current market demand.

Based on these inputs, an intelligent recommendation engine ranks and suggests the most suitable vehicles using rule-based logic or machine learning techniques supported by a structured vehicle dataset. Each recommendation is accompanied by clear expert reasoning to improve transparency and trust. The application is developed using modern web technologies with a clean, responsive user interface, making it suitable for college mini projects, hackathons, and academic evaluation. Overall, the Smart Vehicle Expert System bridges the gap between manual vehicle selection and intelligent decision-making by combining computer vision, expert logic, and user preferences into a unified platform.
